# Participant Consent Form — Keystroke Dynamics Study (Template)

Project title: Keystroke-Security — Keystroke Dynamics Research
Principal investigator / contact: iprartificer\ ishu......@hotmail.com

Purpose
You are invited to participate in a research project that collects typing timing data (keystroke hold times and inter-key flight times) for research into typing behavior and authentication. The purpose is to study behavioral biometric models and improve defensive detection methods.

Voluntary participation
Your participation is voluntary. You may withdraw at any time without penalty. If you withdraw, your data will be [describe how data will be deleted/anonymized].

What data will be collected
- Timing of keystrokes for short typed phrases (hold times, flight times).
- No keystroke content will be stored beyond the required tokens for the experiment (if text content is recorded, it will be anonymized as described below).
- No screenshots, system logs, passwords, or other sensitive inputs will be collected.

How data will be used
- Data will be used for research into typing-behavior models and defensive detection methods.
- Aggregated results (models, plots, anonymized datasets) may be published or shared for research.

Data storage and privacy
- Raw data will be stored on encrypted storage at [location/service].
- Identifiers (name, email) will be stored separately from measurement data and replaced with an irreversible ID code.
- Only authorized project members will have access to the raw data.

Risks and benefits
- Minimal risk: this study involves typing tasks only. No direct benefits to you are guaranteed.
- If you feel uncomfortable, you may stop participating at any time.

Data retention and deletion
- Data will be retained for [time period, e.g., 2 years] unless you request deletion earlier.
- To request deletion, contact: [contact email] with your assigned participant ID.

Consent (participant to sign)
By signing below, I confirm that:
- I am at least 18 years old.
- I have read and understood the information above.
- I consent to the collection and use of my keystroke timing data for the purposes described.
